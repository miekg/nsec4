The Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Extensions introduced the NSEC
resource record for authenticated denial of existence, and the NSEC3
resource record for hashed authenticated denial of existence.  This document
introduces an alternative resource record, NSEC4, which similarly provides 
authenticated denial of existence. It permits gradual expansion of
delegation-centric zones, just like NSEC3 does. 
With NSEC4 it is possible, but not required, to provide 
measures against zone enumeration.

NSEC4 reduces the size of the denial of existence response and
adds Opt-Out to unhashed names. NSEC4 unifies NSEC and NSEC3.
